/**
 * Touch handling.
 *
 * A tap on a touchscreen produces a synthetic `mouseenter`/`mousemove` shortly
 * after the finger lifts. The guide previews a programme on hover, so without a
 * guard a tap would preview whatever the finger happened to pass over on its
 * way up, fighting the tap that was actually intended.
 *
 * The timestamp is deliberately held ONCE for the whole guide rather than
 * per block. Per-element timestamps do not work: the synthetic event usually
 * lands on a *different* element than the one that was touched, so that
 * element's own timestamp is unset and the guard misses.

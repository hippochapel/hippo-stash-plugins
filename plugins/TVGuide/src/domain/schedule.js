 * Deterministic broadcast scheduling.
 *
 * A channel's programming is a pure function of (channel id, scene pool, day).
 * Nothing is stored: reload the page and the same programme is still playing,
 * at an offset that has advanced by exactly the elapsed wall-clock time. Two
 * browsers looking at the same channel agree without talking to each other.
 *
 * The broadcast day runs from local midnight. Both halves of the calculation
 * pivot on it -- the shuffle is seeded with the day key, and the playback
 * cursor is measured from the day's start -- so the two roll over together and
 * the day restarts cleanly instead of jumping mid-programme.
 *
 * No DOM, no I/O.
